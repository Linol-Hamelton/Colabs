## 2026-09-11 - Protocol v0.1 to v1.0 rework

Agent: Claude (Opus 5)

Action:
Ran `git init` and committed v0.1 verbatim as `ae5e831` before changing
anything. Rewrote `AGENTS.md` as an executable protocol: ranked sources of
truth, a write partition per agent, numeric size limits, an encoding rule.
Added `CLAUDE.md` so Claude Code actually loads the rules. Split the shared
worklog into `.ai/worklog/<agent>.md`. Removed `.ai/DISCUSSION.md` and moved
open questions into `.ai/TASK.md`. Rewrote `setup-ai-protocol.ps1` as a copier
over the canonical files instead of a generator carrying its own copies. Wrote
`validate-protocol.ps1` and the two hooks. Added `README.md`.

Result:
Recorded as DEC-0001 through DEC-0008. The v0.1 encoding bug is gone at its
root: every `.ps1` file is ASCII-only and the validator fails the build if that
stops being true. Verified by installing into two empty directories and
running the validator there.

Two bugs found and fixed during the work, both my own:
- The Stop hook missed changes because `git status --porcelain` collapses an
  untracked directory into one entry. Fixed with `-uall`.
- Both scripts died on a repository with no commits, because Windows
  PowerShell 5.1 turns a native command's stderr into a terminating error when
  `ErrorActionPreference` is `Stop`. Replaced `rev-parse --verify HEAD` with
  `rev-list --all --count`, which writes nothing to stderr.

Next step:
Owner starts the test project. The first real task goes into `.ai/TASK.md`,
and this protocol gets its first run against actual work rather than its own
scaffolding.

Open:
- Codex does not read `.claude/`, so it has no equivalent of the hooks. Its
  compliance is voluntary and that asymmetry is untested.
- v1.0 has never been exercised on a real task. Every claim about it being
  workable is untested until that happens.
- Not committed. AGENTS.md section 4 says the owner decides when to commit.
